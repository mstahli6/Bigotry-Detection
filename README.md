# Bigotry Detection

This repository contains the work of my first data science project. The project applies data science techinques to annotated Reddit comment data and emotion sensor features, culminating in a successful bigotry detection model.

### Emotion Sensor Data
[Csv dataset](https://github.com/mstahli6/Capstone_Two_MS_SB_Repo/blob/main/Emotion%20Sensor%20Data/Andbrain_DataSet.csv) of 1004 words scored on seven emotions. 

### Business Case:
This project will use labeled Reddit data to create a detection model that flags comments that likely contain bigotry. The application is for businesses willing to build a reviewing team to go through comments flagged by the detection model, Ã  la human-in-the-loop (HITL). This has the obvious drawback of requiring more resources in terms of human-worked-hours, but avoids the potential of filtering out comments that were never an issue in the first place.  We assume that the business has the capacity to review up to 10% of comment traffic on their platform.
